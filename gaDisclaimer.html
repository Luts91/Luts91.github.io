    <p class="font_8">13. AD IDENTIFIERS, COOKIES, AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</p>

    

    <p class="font_8">Overview:</p>

    <p class="font_8">To provide our Games, Websites and interest-based advertising, we use ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies. Please read this section to understand our use of these technologies and how you can manage your preferences.</p>

    

    <p class="font_8">Further Details:</p>

    

    <p class="font_8">WHAT THEY ARE. Ad identifiers are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple's ID for advertising (the ‘IDFA’), which are uniquely associated with your device. Similar technologies include tracking pixels within ads. These technologies allow companies (including marketers and advertisers) to recognize your device when you use websites and applications.</p>

    <p class="font_8">A cookie is a small string of information that a website you visit transfers to your device for identification purposes. Cookies can be used to follow your online activity on the website and that information helps us to understand your preferences and improve your experience. Cookies are also used for such activities as remembering your user name and password, if such feature is available and you choose to use it.</p>

    

    <p class="font_8">HOW WE USE THEM. Ad identifiers, cookies and similar technologies are used by us to provide our Services to you and in order to collect data from your device. These technologies allow us and our third party advertising partners to:</p>

    <p class="font_8">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recognize you and your device;</p>

    <p class="font_8">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provide interest-based advertising to you;</p>

    <p class="font_8">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allow our Services to interact with a third party social network or platform (where you have chosen to allow such interaction);</p>

    <p class="font_8">·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enable us and third parties to provide you with more customized services, for example to provide our Services in the correct language.</p>

    

    <p class="font_8">TURNING OFF COOKIES. You can turn off all cookies, in case you prefer not to receive them. You can also have your device warn you whenever cookies are being used. For both options you have to adjust your browser settings (such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, or other browser). There are also software products available that can manage cookies for you. Please be aware, however, that when you choose to reject cookies, this choice may limit the Services’ functionality and you may lose access to some of its features.</p>

    

    <p class="font_8">ADJUSTING INTEREST BASED ADVERTISING PREFERENCES. You can choose to prevent your device's ad identifier being used for interest-based advertising, or you can reset your device's ad identifier, by changing the settings of your device. Settings vary from device to device but you will usually find the ad identifier settings under "privacy" or "ads" in your device's settings.</p>

    <p class="font_8">If you live in the USA, Europe or Canada, you can also opt-out from the collection of your information by some or all of our advertising partners who participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance by visiting&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank" data-content="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" data-type="external" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a></span>&nbsp;(for US users),&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank" data-content="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/" data-type="external" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a></span>&nbsp;(for European users) or&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://youradchoices.ca/choices" target="_blank" data-content="http://youradchoices.ca/choices" data-type="external" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://youradchoices.ca/choices</a></span>(for Canadian users). You can also click on the AdChoices logo within an advertisement (where available). If you choose to adjust your preferences in order to prevent these technologies, you may find that you cannot enjoy the full use of our Services.</p>

    

    <p class="font_8">Please note&nbsp;that adjusting your preferences as described in this section does not mean you will no longer receive adverts, it only means the adverts you do see will be less relevant to your interests. We will also still use your device’s ad identifier to serve you with ads; for example, we may use this for frequency capping (in other words, to control the maximum number of times you see the same ad from us).</p>

    

    <p class="font_8">14. OPT-OUT RIGHTS</p>

    

    <p class="font_8">To stop all collection of information from the Website, leave and discontinue use of the Website. You can also easily stop all collection of information through a Game by uninstalling the Game.</p>
